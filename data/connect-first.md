People work better together when they have a human connection - when they feel they know each other on a personal level as well as professionally. Perhaps someone has had a difficult day, or is stressed about something outside of work? Knowing what mood people in the ensemble are in today, is good to be more kind and sympathetic to each other. Therefore, at the most basic level, at the beginning of the ensemble session, take a few minutes to ask everyone how they are, and let everyone share something about their day so far. Or, once you know each other better, perhaps prompt about when each and everyone is looking forward to, or share some thoughts and feelings about book that they've read. As a facilitator, make sure the prompt is easy and limited enough to keep within a couple of minutes or so, especially if it's a large ensemble, otherwise the connect first enabler can grow to eat up a lot of the session!
