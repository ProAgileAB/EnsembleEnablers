People work better together when they have a human connection - when they feel they know each other on a personal level as well as professionally. Perhaps someone has had a difficult day, or is stressed about something outside of work? Knowing what mood people in the ensemble are in today, is good to be more kind and sympathetic to each other.

Therefore, at the beginning of the ensemble session, take a few minutes to connect to each other - connect first. E.g ask everyone how they are, and let people share something about their day so far. Or, once you know each other better, perhaps prompt about what people are looking forward to during the year, or share some thoughts and feelings about a book they've read.

As a facilitator, try to use a prompt that is easy and limited enough to keep within a couple of minutes or so, especially if it's a large ensemble. Otherwise the connect first enabler can grow to eat up a lot of the session!
