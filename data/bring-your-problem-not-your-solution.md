Scenario: someone in the team really likes coding in isolation, coming up with a solution-design-architecture
on their own. And then brings that solution to the team - either as a pull request or as a sketch of a solution - it can become real frustration for the team when ensembling.

What happens is that the problem-solving part is left out of the team effort. This means the ensemble-team becomes an execute only ensemble; not a learning team.

Bringing a problem instead of a solution has several advantages: we don't miss out on getting more eyes on the design/solution/architecture, which often means a better solution, not only technically but also team-alignment-wise.
It also leaves out the frustration of being code monkeys only.

So this enabler suggests that you set you mind free of preconceived ideas and focusing those efforts on instead trying to formulate more clearly what problem you are trying to solve, and trust the team to do so.
