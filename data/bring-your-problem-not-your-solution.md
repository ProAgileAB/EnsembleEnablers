If someone has an eager coding, and likes coding a lot in isolation, coming up with a solution-design-architecture on their own, even if it's sketches or 'in their head', it can become a frustration for the team when ensembling.

What happens is that the problem solving part is left out of the team effort - it becomes an 'execute only' ensemble.

Formulated in other words, this is about bringing a problem to the ensemble/team to solve - not a solution.

Bringing a problem instead of a solution has several advantages: we don't miss out on getting more eyes on the design/solution/architecture, which often means a better solution, not only technically but also team-alignment-wise.

So this enabler suggests that you set you mind free of preconcieved ideas from your chamber, and focus those efforts on instead trying to formulate more clearly what problem you are trying to solve, and trust the team to do so.
