It needs to feel safe to take part in an ensemble - and in particular to navigate. As a facilitator, you normally put everyone in the rotation by default - you want the whole team to be engaged and involved. However, sometimes itâ€™s better to let people choose when to add themselves into the rotation. Particularly if they have missed a previous session or if they are new to the team. Welcome them and let them observe until they are ready to step into the rotation. That could be the entire session. What usually happens, however, is that the the person joins after only some rotations.

To use this ensemble enabler, simply state to the new/shy person that it is OK to just stay in the background observing what is happening for as long as they want, and join the ensemble when they feel ready - or not at all in this session; either is fine.
