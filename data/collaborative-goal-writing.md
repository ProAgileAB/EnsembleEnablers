These are symptoms the team is not aligned on the goal of the session.

One way to address this is to be more explicit about the goal, not only talk about it but also write it down.

This goal writing could be as simple as someone sharing screen in beginning of session, and writing a GOAL.txt or README.md file, which can then live in the source control for the next session.

If you try this approach, make sure to time-box the goal writing to 20 minutes or something like that, and be cautious of the trap of going into details of implementation when writing the goal(s) down - keep the language as abstract as possible, as close to the domain or user language. E.g "Goal: users can sort on dates not only names in search result page" rather than "update SQL query for sorting on dates".
