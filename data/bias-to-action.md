Discussion is an important element of ensemble working. However, if the ensemble never write any code then that can kill people's enthusiasm for working together.

Longer discussions can be a symptom that people don't understand the problem well enough yet to agree on a good approach to solve it. Instead of yet more discussions, what can often help is just picking one approach and trying to code it together.

If it turns out not to work, then you'll probably have *learnt more* than you would have by continuing to discuss ideas abstractly.

"Bias to action" means just this - let's write some code, learn something about it, and do it now instead of continuing to try to analyze our way to a solution. We can discuss more later when we've learnt more about the problem!

There might also be strong wills in the team on what approach to take to solve something, have a look at the enabler *try both with a timebox* for that situation.

The longer discussions could also be caused by the team not knowing each other very well and/or not having a common design vocabulary, so they don't understand one another. If that is the case, then general team development exercises or a workshop on design principles might help.
