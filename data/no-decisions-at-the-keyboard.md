_For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands_

That's Llewellyn Falco's description of "strong-style" pair programming. For an ensemble, this is even more important. If every idea is open and transparent, expressed in a form so that it can be discussed as it makes its way into the code, we are in a better position to build good stuff together.

The typist has the hardest job here, because they have to break their habit of both thinking and typing themselves. Instead, they need to put more effort into listening - in particular to the navigator, and translating their ideas into code.

Why is this a good idea? The reason for this is that it encourages us to talk about the code together, as a team, instead of 'silently' developing the system in isolation. This helps spreading domain knowledge, tooling proficiency, code practices and so on, and builds a common language for the team to use. To the benefit of everyone, and particularly those new to the team.

If you notice the typist is rushing ahead writing code for an idea that hasn't been discussed, you could intervene straight away and talk about this ensemble enabler. Kindly suggest "more listening, less thinking at the keyboard". Perhaps also bring it up at the retrospective.
