When it becomes clear there's a gap in the team's knowledge, and parallell research has been tried some times, you may have to find help from outside the ensemble.

Perhaps this would be a good time to borrow someone from another team who does have that knowledge - can you phone them and have them join you for half an hour? Perhaps they could navigate for a short while. Or be invited the next ensemble session.
