It seems the balance in the team is not there at all - one person 'is' the team, when it comes to solutions, ideas, implementations.

This is a symptom that knowledge sharing is low, and could use a boost. A great way to make that happen is to call out the 'hands off the keyboard!' enabler.

This simply means, that the one with the expert knowledge should _not_ be the typist, instead focusing on navigating others so they get up to speed with the code base and domain. The rotations could be on the typist role only, keeping the same expert-navigator for a whole day or similar.

There is also a challenging twist on this enablers, which says the complete opposite: the expert should _only_ stay at the keyboard, and let others navigate (without making decisions at the keyboard, see separate enabler). This could for example be used after some week, when the rest of the team is more knowledgeable. Before that is just crazy challenging and frustration for both the expert and the rest of the team, since the team won't know what to do, and the typist will (but won't be able to express!).
