This enabler is about a situation which ideally isn't too common: no-one knows what a fruitful next step is to solve a task.

The suggestion is to break up the ensemble for some time, maybe 10 minutes or so, and let everyone gather data-information-google and so on, and share with the ensemble, perhaps paste in a team chat or similar.

When the time is up, show the teamâ€™s search results on the shared screen and have people explain what they learned. Hopefully someone will gain enough insight to volunteer to continue navigation!

If this happens a lot, you could try the invite-an-expert enabler.
