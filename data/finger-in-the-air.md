If everyone talks immediately, whenever they feel like it, then the navigator may become frustrated at the constant interruptions. And the typist will have a hard time judging who's ideas to implement. This ensemble enabler will make communication less choppy and interrupted, and leave the navigator feeling more in control.

Therefore, we suggest this simple protocol for communicating when you're not navigating: 

 * Raise one finger to get the navigator’s attention
 * If your concern is really urgent, raise two fingers instead of one
 * Only if it really, really can’t wait, speak up and interrupt (last resort!)

It is up to the navigator to notice your raised finger(s), and then choose when to call on you to explain your idea.

_Remote note_: If you’re not in the same room, or your webcams are off, most remote meetings have a ‘raise hand’ or similar function you can use instead.
