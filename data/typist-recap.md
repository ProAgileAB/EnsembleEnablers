When the timer goes off, before the next navigator begins, the typist summarizes what they have been doing for the previous few minutes. They should aim to be concise (take less than 1 minute) and explain at as high a level as they can manage - as near â€˜intention' as possible.

This should be a real help to the next navigator, who hopefully will be able to carry on in the same direction as the previous person. If the typist has difficulty explaining what's been happening, it can be a sign the direction and intention has not been spoken in the ensemble, and a short explanation from the previous navigator would be beneficial.

This is a challenging enabler, which really practices each person's ability to express things at an intentional level.
