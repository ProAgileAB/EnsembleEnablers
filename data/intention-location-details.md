The communication between the navigator and typist is not working well enough, the navigator is not speaking at the correct level for the driver's current needs.

* **Intention**: Explain at a high level what you're trying to achieve, and what problem it is you're working on. *Always begin with this.*
* **Location**: If the typist needs more before they know what to do, then describe where you want them to do something. Which file, function, line? Which part of the screen? Which tool should they use?
* **Details**: If the typist still needs more, go into detail. Describe the exact syntax, the types of the variables, where to put the semicolons. Which buttons to press and what keyboard shortcuts to use.

This enabler will hopefully reduce this frustration for the typist. As a navigator using intention-location-details enabler, you're treating the typist first as an intelligent person who knows a lot about coding, and gradually giving them more as you discover what more details they need right now given the cognitive complexity of the task.

This enabler will likely also help with handover to the next navigator, since the high-level goal - the intention or purpose - is clear and has been spoken to everyone on the team.
