# Ensemble Enablers - what is this repo?

This repo documents patterns we've found useful while
coaching teams in Ensemble Programming.


## I want to update the README

Please do not update this README, instead modify
`enablers.json`. If you see some error in these
general instructions, modify `build.py` which
contain this pre-amble.


## How to add an enabler?

Update the enablers.json file, then run this command:

    python build.py

This will update README.md if no obvious errors were
found in enablers.json.

# ENSEMBLE ENABLERS BELOW

# Bias to action

## Symptoms



## Proposal

# Collaborative Ensemble Timer Setup

## Symptoms



## Proposal

# Connect first

## Symptoms

 * Ensemble is quiet, no banter
 * Navigator transfer is not smooth, frequently changing direction and focus
 * Conversation seems forced


## Proposal

People work better together when they have a human connection, when they feel they know each other on a personal level as well as professionally. Perhaps someone has had a difficult day, or is stressed about something outside of work. At the beginning of the ensemble session, take a few minutes to ask everyone how they are, and let everyone share something about their day so far. Aim to create an atmosphere where people feel comfortable and behave in a friendly way to one another.

## Symptoms



## Proposal

# Intention-location-details (ILD)

## Symptoms

 * Typist is frustrated or inactive. Deleting stuff, scrolling, or writing unexpected code
 * Difficulty when switching navigator - next navigator doesn’t follow what’s happening
 * Ensemble is losing focus (eg checking their phones)


## Proposal

The communication between the navigator and typist is not working well enough, the navigator is not speaking at the correct level for the driver’s current needs.

* *Intention*: Explain at a high level what you’re trying to achieve, and what problem it is you’re working on. Always begin with this.
* *Location*: If the typist needs more before they know what to do, then describe where you want them to do something. Which file, function, line? Which part of the screen? Which tool should they use?
* *Details*: If the typist still needs more, go into detail. Describe the exact syntax, the types of the variables, where to put the semicolons. Which buttons to press and what keyboard shortcuts to use.

This enabler should help prevent the typist from becoming frustrated. You’re treating them first as an intelligent person who knows a lot about coding, and gradually giving them more as you discover what more details they need right now given the cognitive complexity of the task and their current capacity. It also helps the handover to the next navigator because the intention and purpose is clear and has been spoken to everyone.

# Kindness, Consideration and Respect

## Symptoms



## Proposal

# No decisions at the keyboard

*Also known has: More listening at the keyboard*

## Symptoms

 * Typist is talking as much or more than the navigator
 * Navigator is quiet or uncertain
 * Typist writes code that the navigator didn’t talk about


## Proposal

The typist is not supposed to have their own ideas, they should be channeling the ideas from the navigator and the rest of the ensemble into the codebase.

"For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands"

That’s Llewellyn Falco’s description of “strong-style” pair programming. For an ensemble, this is even more important. Every idea should be spoken: expressed in a form so that it can be discussed and analyzed as it makes its way into the code. The typist has the hardest job here, because they have to break their habit of both thinking and typing themselves. Instead they need to put more effort into listening - in particular to the navigator, and translating their ideas into code.

If you notice the typist is rushing ahead writing code for an idea that hasn’t been discussed, you should probably intervene straight away. Kindly suggest “more listening, less thinking at the keyboard”. Perhaps also bring it up at the retrospective.
