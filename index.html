<h1 id='connect-first'>Connect first</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

 <li>Ensemble is quiet, no banter</li>
 <li>Navigator transfer is not smooth, frequently changing direction and focus</li>
 <li>Conversation seems forced</li>


<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>People work better together when they have a human connection - when they feel they know each other on a personal level as well as professionally. Perhaps someone has had a difficult day, or is stressed about something outside of work? Knowing what mood people in the ensemble are in today, is good to be more kind and sympathetic to each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of the ensemble session, take a few minutes to connect to each other - connect first. E.g ask everyone how they are, and let people share something about their day so far. Or, once you know each other better, perhaps prompt about what people are looking forward to during the year, or share some thoughts and feelings about a book they've read.</p>
<p>As a facilitator, try to use a prompt that is easy and limited enough to keep within a couple of minutes or so, especially if it's a large ensemble. Otherwise the connect first enabler can grow to eat up a lot of the session!</p>

<h1 id='intention-location-details'>Intention-location-details</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

 <li>Typist is frustrated or inactive. Deleting stuff, scrolling, or writing unexpected code</li>
 <li>Difficulty when switching navigator - next navigator doesn't follow what's happening</li>
 <li>Ensemble is losing focus (eg checking their phones)</li>


<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>The communication between the navigator and typist is not working well enough, the navigator is not speaking at the correct level for the driver's current needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intention</strong>: Explain at a high level what you're trying to achieve, and what problem it is you're working on. <em>Always begin with this.</em></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: If the typist needs more before they know what to do, then describe where you want them to do something. Which file, function, line? Which part of the screen? Which tool should they use?</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong>: If the typist still needs more, go into detail. Describe the exact syntax, the types of the variables, where to put the semicolons. Which buttons to press and what keyboard shortcuts to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>This enabler should help prevent the typist from becoming frustrated. You're treating them first as an intelligent person who knows a lot about coding, and gradually giving them more as you discover what more details they need right now given the cognitive complexity of the task and their current capacity. It also helps the handover to the next navigator because the intention and purpose is clear and has been spoken to everyone.</p>

 <li>Parallell research has been tried several times and not much progress made</li>
 <li>Team is struggling with making progress due to lack of experience</li>

<i>Also known as: More listening at the keyboard</i>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

 <li>Typist is talking as much or more than the navigator</li>
 <li>Navigator is quiet or uncertain</li>
 <li>Typist writes code that the navigator didn't talk about</li>


<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p><em>For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands</em></p>
<p>That's Llewellyn Falco's description of "strong-style" pair programming. For an ensemble, this is even more important. If every idea is open and transparent, expressed in a form so that it can be discussed as it makes its way into the code, we are in a better position to build good stuff together.</p>
<p>The typist has the hardest job here, because they have to break their habit of both thinking and typing themselves. Instead, they need to put more effort into listening - in particular to the navigator, and translating their ideas into code.</p>
<p>Why is this a good idea? The reason for this is that it encourages us to talk about the code together, as a team, instead of 'silently' developing the system in isolation. This helps spreading domain knowledge, tooling proficiency, code practices and so on, and builds a common language for the team to use. To the benefit of everyone, and particularly those new to the team.</p>
<p>If you notice the typist is rushing ahead writing code for an idea that hasn't been discussed, you could intervene straight away and talk about this ensemble enabler. Kindly suggest "more listening, less thinking at the keyboard". Perhaps also bring it up at the retrospective.</p>
