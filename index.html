<h1 id='bias-to-action'>Bias to action</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Discussions go on for more than (say) 20 minutes without code being written</li>
 <li>Every time the navigator makes a design decision, someone else wants to correct or improve something about it before they have get any code written</li>
 <li>Team is stuck in 'analysis-paralysis' with a lot of speculation on which approach to take</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>Discussion is an important element of ensemble working. However, if the ensemble never write any code then that can kill people's enthusiasm for working together.</p>
<p>Longer discussions can be a symptom that people don't understand the problem well enough yet to agree on a good approach to solve it. Instead of yet more discussions, what can often help is just picking one approach and trying to code it together.</p>
<p>If it turns out not to work, then you'll probably have <em>learnt more</em> than you would have by continuing to discuss ideas abstractly.</p>
<p>"Bias to action" means just this - let's write some code, learn something about it, and do it now instead of continuing to try to analyze our way to a solution. We can discuss more later when we've learnt more about the problem!</p>
<p>There might also be strong wills in the team on what approach to take to solve something, have a look at the enabler <em>try both with a timebox</em> for that situation.</p>
<p>The longer discussions could also be caused by the team not knowing each other very well and/or not having a common design vocabulary, so they don't understand one another. If that is the case, then general team development exercises or a workshop on design principles might help.</p>

<h1 id='collaborative-ensemble-timer-setup'>Collaborative ensemble timer setup</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Discover someone is missing from the rotations</li>
 <li>Discover someone is absent from the meeting but present in the timer</li>
 <li>Realize the timer has not alerted you to rotate as often as you expected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>Before starting rotations, have everyone in the ensemble help to configure it. This means more eyes on the problem, errors (who's in the ensemble today? How many minute rotations? Is the audible bell setup?) is fixed quickly instead of interrupting flow later.</p>
</div>

<div class='enabler'>

<h1 id='connect-first'>Connect first</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Ensemble is quiet, no banter</li>
 <li>Navigator transfer is not smooth, frequently changing direction and focus</li>
 <li>Conversation seems forced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>People work better together when they have a human connection - when they feel they know each other on a personal level as well as professionally. Perhaps someone has had a difficult day, or is stressed about something outside of work? Knowing what mood people in the ensemble are in today, is good to be more kind and sympathetic to each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of the ensemble session, take a few minutes to connect to each other - connect first. E.g ask everyone how they are, and let people share something about their day so far. Or, once you know each other better, perhaps prompt about what people are looking forward to during the year, or share some thoughts and feelings about a book they've read.</p>
<p>As a facilitator, try to use a prompt that is easy and limited enough to keep within a couple of minutes or so, especially if it's a large ensemble. Otherwise the connect first enabler can grow to eat up a lot of the session!</p>

<h1 id='finger-in-the-air'>Finger in the air</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Navigator is interrupted by rest of ensemble</li>
 <li>Typist does not know who to listen to</li>
 <li>“Flow” is not happening</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>If everyone talks immediately, whenever they feel like it, then the navigator may become frustrated at the constant interruptions. And the typist will have a hard time judging who's ideas to implement. This ensemble enabler will make communication less choppy and interrupted, and leave the navigator feeling more in control.</p>
<p>Therefore, we suggest this simple protocol for communicating when you're not navigating: </p>
<ul>
<li>Raise one finger to get the navigator's attention</li>
<li>If your concern is really urgent, raise two fingers instead of one</li>
<li>Only if it really, really can't wait, speak up and interrupt (last resort!)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is up to the navigator to notice your raised finger(s), and then choose when to call on you to explain your idea.</p>
<p><em>Remote note</em>: If you're not in the same room, or your webcams are off, most remote meetings have a ‘raise hand' or similar function you can use instead.</p>

<h1 id='intention-location-details'>Intention-location-details</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Typist is frustrated or inactive. Deleting stuff, scrolling, or writing unexpected code</li>
 <li>Difficulty when switching navigator - next navigator doesn't follow what's happening</li>
 <li>Ensemble is losing focus (e.g checking their phones)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>The communication between the navigator and typist is not working well enough, the navigator is not speaking at the correct level for the driver's current needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intention</strong>: Explain at a high level what you're trying to achieve, and what problem it is you're working on. <em>Always begin with this.</em></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: If the typist needs more before they know what to do, then describe where you want them to do something. Which file, function, line? Which part of the screen? Which tool should they use?</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong>: If the typist still needs more, go into detail. Describe the exact syntax, the types of the variables, where to put the semicolons. Which buttons to press and what keyboard shortcuts to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>This enabler will hopefully reduce this frustration for the typist. As a navigator using intention-location-details enabler, you're treating the typist first as an intelligent person who knows a lot about coding, and gradually giving them more as you discover what more details they need right now given the cognitive complexity of the task.</p>
<p>This enabler will likely also help with handover to the next navigator, since the high-level goal - the intention or purpose - is clear and has been spoken to everyone on the team.</p>
</div>

<h1 id='invite-an-expert'>Invite an expert</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The team keeps referring to another team (or member of another team)</li>
 <li>Parallell research has been tried several times and not much progress made</li>
 <li>Team is struggling with making progress due to lack of experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>When it becomes clear there's a gap in the team's knowledge, and parallell research has been tried some times, you may have to find help from outside the ensemble.</p>
<p>Perhaps this would be a good time to borrow someone from another team who does have that knowledge - can you phone them and have them join you for half an hour? Perhaps they could navigate for a short while. Or be invited the next ensemble session.</p>
</div>

<div class='enabler'>

<h1 id='join-at-will'>Join at will</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>People seem stressed, particularly when they take over the navigator role</li>
 <li>There is a new or shy member of the team, that hasn't done any ensemble programming before</li>
 <li>Someone missed the previous session and asks to skip navigation when it’s their turn</li>
 <li>People you expected to be there don’t turn up to the session at all</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>It order for everyone to participate with engagement and heart, t needs to feel safe to take part in an ensemble - and in particular to navigate. Normally everyone will be in the rotations - we want the whole team to be contributing, engaged and involved.</p>
<p>However, sometimes it's better to let people choose when to add themselves into the rotation. Particularly if they have missed a previous session or if they are new to the team. Welcome them and let them observe until they are ready to step into the rotation. That could be the entire session. What usually happens, however, is that the the person joins after only some rotations.</p>
<p>To use this ensemble enabler, simply state to the new/shy person that it is OK to just stay in the background observing what is happening for as long as they want, and join the ensemble when they feel ready - or not at all in this session; either is fine.</p>

<h1 id='no-decisions-at-the-keyboard'>No decisions at the keyboard</h1></a>

<i>Also known as: More listening at the keyboard</i>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Typist is talking as much or more than the navigator</li>
 <li>Navigator is quiet or uncertain</li>
 <li>Typist writes code that the navigator didn't talk about</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p><em>For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else's hands</em></p>
<p>That's Llewellyn Falco's description of "strong-style" pair programming. For an ensemble, this is even more important. If every idea is open and transparent, expressed in a form so that it can be discussed as it makes its way into the code, we are in a better position to build good stuff together.</p>
<p>The typist has the hardest job here, because they have to break their habit of both thinking and typing themselves. Instead, they need to put more effort into listening - in particular to the navigator, and translating their ideas into code.</p>
<p>Why is this a good idea? The reason for this is that it encourages us to talk about the code together, as a team, instead of 'silently' developing the system in isolation. This helps spreading domain knowledge, tooling proficiency, code practices and so on, and builds a common language for the team to use. To the benefit of everyone, and particularly those new to the team.</p>
<p>If you notice the typist is rushing ahead writing code for an idea that hasn't been discussed, you could intervene straight away and talk about this ensemble enabler. Kindly suggest "more listening, less thinking at the keyboard". Perhaps also bring it up at the retrospective.</p>
</div>

<div class='enabler'>

<h1 id='parallell-research'>Parallell research</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Nobody in the team knows the details of how to do something well enough to explain it to the typist</li>
 <li>The team is working with an unfamiliar programming language or framework and just gets stuck</li>
 <li>The codebase is huge and no-one in the team is knowledgeable about where to make changes for current user story</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>This enabler is about a situation which ideally isn't too common: no-one knows what a fruitful next step is to solve a task.</p>
<p>The suggestion is to break up the ensemble for some time, maybe 10 minutes or so, and let everyone gather data-information-google and so on, and share with the ensemble, perhaps paste in a team chat or similar.</p>
<p>When the time is up, show the team's search results on the shared screen and have people explain what they learned. Hopefully someone will gain enough insight to volunteer to continue navigation!</p>
<p>If this happens a lot, you could try the invite-an-expert enabler.</p>
</div>

<div class='enabler'>

<h1 id='pause-the-timer'>Pause the timer</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>One or two people are dominating</li>
 <li>Dissenting opinions and ideas are being ignored, or override each other</li>
 <li>A suggestion is repeatedly raised without ever being discussed properly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>We're interested in the best ideas making it into the code, so if people have ideas that are being ignored, there's a danger we'll miss something important, or hinder the team from growing in collaboration.</p>
<p>It may help the team to listen to all voices if you pause the timer and ask them to discuss the idea or proposal you feel they have not paid attention to, and why it helps to collaborate and work on the problem together.</p>
<p>Remind the team that we want the best ideas to make it into the code, and good ideas can come from anyone in the team.</p>
<p>Read also: This is kind of the opposite to the enabler bias-to-action, which is for the case where the team is stalling on analysis-paralysis which hinders learning. Here, the team is steaming-on without paying attention to the smaller voices of the team, missing opportunities for growth and learning.</p>
</div>

<div class='enabler'>

<h1 id='shout-out-roles'>Shout out roles</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>When the navigator rotates, they are unprepared (comes as a surprise)</li>
 <li>Someone notices the timer ran out some time ago and we forgot to rotate</li>
 <li>Little engagement, people are losing focus and attention</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>To alleviate symptoms like the ones above it could help to make the ensemble more attentive to who is doing what and when.</p>
<p>Therefore, at rotation, this enabler proposes a simple attention bringing trick: the new navigator calls out all the roles. Something like “John is typing, I'm navigating, Sue is next”. It's an awareness trick so that people are reminded of their current roles, and particularly for the person who is ‘next' to sit up and take notice. It gives the new navigator the attention of the group.</p>

<h1 id='typist-recap'>Typist recap</h1></a>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
 <li>When the navigator rotates, the next navigator has trouble picking up the direction</li>
 <li>Lots of discussion, not much progress</li>
 <li>Each navigator seems to take a different direction from the previous one</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>When the timer goes off, before the next navigator begins, the typist summarizes what they have been doing for the previous few minutes. They should aim to be concise (take less than 1 minute) and explain at as high a level as they can manage - as near ‘intention' as possible.</p>
<p>This should be a real help to the next navigator, who hopefully will be able to carry on in the same direction as the previous person. If the typist has difficulty explaining what's been happening, it can be a sign the direction and intention has not been spoken in the ensemble, and a short explanation from the previous navigator would be beneficial.</p>
<p>This is a challenging enabler, which really practices each persons ability to express things at an intentional level.</p>
